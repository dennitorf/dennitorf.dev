## Hello, I'm Denny Rodriguez! ðŸ‘‹

Cuban by birth, I consider myself an aspiring software engineer (with a **Bs. in Computers Science**). I was born in Bayamo, Cuba, a city with a lot of history.

I liked the idea of starting a [Blogging](/blog/) to share experiences and **help colleagues and IT folks**.

Entusiast about competitive programming, I focus on developing **modern web applications**, with an emphasis on the **Microsoft/Azure** technology ecosystem and front-end frameworks (Angular, React).

I am an [amative photographer](https://counterpartphoto.myportfolio.com/), in love with Canon and photojournalism.

I'm also motivated to create personal projects at home; I have a couple of servers running a mini-cloud, and I enjoy trying out new things.
